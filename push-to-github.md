# Manual GitHub Push Instructions

Since Replit's Git interface isn't detecting the repository, here are your options:

## Option 1: Shell Commands (Try First)
Open the Shell tab in Replit and run these commands:

```bash
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Complete WhyRebate platform with HomeSmart branding"
git push origin main
```

## Option 2: Reset Git Integration
If shell doesn't work, try reconnecting:

1. In Replit, go to Settings (gear icon)
2. Look for "Git" or "GitHub" integration
3. Disconnect and reconnect to: https://github.com/edholman/RebateTracker.git

## Option 3: Download and Upload
If git integration fails:

1. Download project as ZIP from Replit
2. Extract files locally
3. Upload to GitHub repository manually
4. This gets your code there immediately

## What Should Be Uploaded:
- Complete React frontend (client/)
- Express backend (server/)
- Database schema (shared/)
- All UI components
- HomeSmart branding assets
- Configuration files
- README.md

Your project is complete and ready - we just need to get it to GitHub.
